This is an assembly language brush for the "SyntaxHighlighter Evolved" plugin. It will enable customizable highlighting of assembly code.

== Description ==

asm-brush is small WordPress plugin I wrote and dedicated to the dinosaurs (like me) who still use and want to share assembly language source code. It is a brush designed to work with the SyntaxHighlighter Evolved http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/ WordPress plugin (written by Viper), itself based on the SyntaxHighlighter JavaScript package by Alex Gorbatchev. To be able to use this brush, you will need the asm-brush as well as the SyntaxHighlighter Evolved plugins installed.

To highlight your assembly code, simply wrap it between [assembly] and [/assembly] or [x86] and [/x86] tags.

The brush detects and applies different styles to the following elements:

- Registers
- Assembly language user instructions
- Assembly language system instructions
- FPU instructions
- Multimedia instructions
- MASM specific directives & instructions
- Numbers (decimal and hexadecimal)
- IDA (The Interactive Disassembler) labels

The styles are easily customizable by editing the CSS file.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will the brush work with other processors? =

Processors have in common some mnemonics, so yes it will, but not everything will be highlighted like with the x86 instruction set, you need to add your particular instructions set to the brush.

= How can I add instructions to the brush? =

By editing the shBrushAsm.js file.
